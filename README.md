# Getting_An_Account

This repository contains the materials for the RC Quick Byte - Getting an Account

New to CU Research Computing, but don't know where to start? This RC Quick Byte* is intended to assist users in setting up a Research Computing account, which is necessary to begin using Alpine. In this workshop, we’ll demonstrate how to get an account, how to set up 2-Factor-Authentication, and how to log in to the CU Research Computing system. You can expect to leave this training with a Research Computing Account and an understanding of how to log in to the CURC system.

This session will be hands-on. We will also be holding CRDDS Consultation Hours (https://colorado.libcal.com/calendar/events/Tuesdays) immediately following this session for any follow-up questions.

* What’s an RC Quick Byte?: An RC Quick Byte is a 20-30 minute sessions intended to provide essential information about a specific topic. You can expect to leave a 'Quick Byte' with the information you need to apply a tool, service, or concept.
